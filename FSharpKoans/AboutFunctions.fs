(*
    A function maps a single input to a single output.  Functions in functional
    languages (and an increasing number of non-functional languages!) are
    *first-class*.  This means that they can be used in every context that
    a variable can be used in.  You'll see them passed around as arguments
    and returned from functions, for example.

    When it comes right down to it, that's the essence of computation:
    taking inputs and mapping them to outputs in line with some logic.
    Unsurprisingly, functions are used everywhere in functional programming!
    In fact, in some other functional languages, things like if-statements are
    just functions rather than keywords.

(*
    In a functional language, functions are used for almost everything.

    In "mainstream" object-orientation (e.g. C# or Java), you would make
    objects and methods and inheritance and all of that jazz to structure your
    program's logic.  Every method must be in an object, and we create
    objects and call methods to make things happen.

    In functional programming, we do all of this with functions.  It is normal
    to make very small functions, and then combine them in various ways to
    achieve a goal.  There are operators in the language to make this easier,
    and these operators (of course!) are merely functions themselves, just like
    (+), (*), (-), and so on.
